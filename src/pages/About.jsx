              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p>
                SurveyAid was born from a simple observation: while working with NGOs in developing countries, 
                I noticed that many organizations were still using paper-based surveys or basic online forms 
                that didn't capture the nuanced data they needed to make informed decisions.
              </p>
              <p>
                After witnessing the challenges of manual data collection and analysis, I decided to create 
                a solution that would make professional survey creation as easy as having a conversation. 
                The result was SurveyAid - a platform that uses AI to help organizations create multilingual surveys in seconds.
